 Nothiing super important in this post, but welcome to my little corner of the internet that I like to call the Edge of Chaos. The ["Edge of Chaos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos) is typically known as a possible state of transition between order and disorder in any system. AFAIK the concept itself is extremely abstract, but something about the idea of its existence intrigues me, so I claimed it as a name for my blog.
 
 I'm not sure how often I will update this blogsite, but I have a daily thought stream I keep updated in a [Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/humdaan/Humdaan-s-Thought-Stream-fc069c7bf84c416f92b91163861ccf3a) and also my [twitter](twitter.com/humishum). 
 
 
 
 I'm always open to chat, DMs and emails are always welcome :) .
